Source Folder (src)
-------------------

This folder contains all the application source code.

What goes here:
- Entry point files (e.g., main.jsx, index.css)
- Core application logic
- Organized subfolders such as:
  • components/  → reusable React components
  • assets/      → static resources imported in code
  • pages/       → top-level views or routes (optional)
  • hooks/       → custom React hooks (optional)
  • utils/       → helper functions or services (optional)

What does NOT go here:
- Build outputs (those go in "dist")
- Configuration files (they stay in the project root)
- Static files served as-is (they belong in the "public" folder)

Notes:
- Keep the src folder clean and modular.
- Each subfolder can include its own README.txt to explain its purpose.
- This structure can grow as the app becomes more complex.
